A `transaction` represents a movement of funds on the Dots platform. There are two main types of transactions: `wallet` and `credit`. A `wallet` transaction is a movement of fiat funds and a `credit` transaction is a movement of credit balance that can be issued by the app but is not backed by money.

A `transaction` can only be created between a user's wallet and your app's wallet in both directions. User to User transactions aren't directly allowed.
