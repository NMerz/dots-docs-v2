title: "Your First Payout"
---

A payout is a transfer of funds from your account to a user's external account. The easiest way to send a payout is through the `send-payout` route. If the user exists within the Dots system, the funds are sent to them based on their saved preferences, otherwise, they are sent a link to onboard.

## Method

1. Create an App
2. Call the `send-payout` endpoint

## 1. Create an App

If you haven't already, create an account at [https://dashboard.dots.dev](https://dashboard.dots.dev) and switch over to Sandbox mode. Head over to the `API Management` tab to generate keys.

## 2. Send the Payout

We will create and send a `Payout Link` to a user whose phone number is known with US $10.

### Request

Please replace the phone number with your own.
