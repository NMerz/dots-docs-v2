title: "Your First Payout"
---

A payout is a transfer of funds from your account to a user. The easiest way to send a payout is through a `Payout Link`.

A `Payout Link` is a link that allows a user to onboard onto Dots and withdraw their funds through their method of choice.

## Method

1. Create an App
2. Create a `Payout Link`
3. Send the user to the `Payout Link`

## 1. Create an App

If you haven't already, create an account at [https://dashboard.dots.dev](https://dashboard.dots.dev) and switch over to Sandbox mode. Head over to the `API Management` tab to generate keys.

## 2. Send the Payout

We will create and send a `Payout Link` to a user whose phone number is known with US $10.

### Request

Please replace the phone number with your own.
