A payout is a transfer of funds from your account to a user. The easiest way to send a payout is through a `Payout Link`.

A `Payout Link` is a link that allows a user to onboard onto Dots and withdraw their funds through their method of choice.

## Method

1. Create an App
2. Create a `Payout Link`
3. Send the user to the `Payout Link`

## 1. Create an App

If you haven't already, create an account at [https://senddotssandbox.com](https://senddotssandbox.com) and head over to the `Developer` tab to create an App.

## 2. Create a Payout Link

We will create a `Payout Link` for a user whose phone number is known with US $10.
